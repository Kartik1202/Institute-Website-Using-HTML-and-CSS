# Institute Website Using HTML and CSS
 A small institute website front-end using HTML and CSS can have a homepage with a slider and Registration page. The Registration page can have a form for students to enter personal and academic details, and select a course. The design should be responsive and match the institute's logo, with well-organized and commented code.
